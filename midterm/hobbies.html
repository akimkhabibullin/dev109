  Believe it or not, I have a lot of hobbies! I like to experiment with different things like sports, music, and just general activities. For as long as I can remember I loved to be active and do things like play outside with friends and play various sports growing up. Some of my top favorite things are soccer, piano, and boxing (not in any particular order). I started playing piano at around 12 when I downloaded and app where the keys drop and you have to click them at the right time, it really interested me, and I got my dad to buy me a cheap piano. From there, I started practicing almost every day playing the easy songs I knew and learning from mostly free piano apps. Then after I got some experience in this, I searched for videos on YouTube of people playing and basically followed along and I learn most of my songs now this way. I have never had a piano teacher and I think thats what makes my story more interesting than others, the fact that I learned it all on my own purely for the love of it.
